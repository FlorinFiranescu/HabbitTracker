# HabbitTracker
Habbit Tracker script, which takes simple commands from console and uses the Pixe.la api to track different habbit. Using this app we can add the time spent today on our habbits, create new habbits or update previous days. 
This has been a good exercise that puts in practice different request methods, such as post, get, put and delete
